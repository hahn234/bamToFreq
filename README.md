# bamToFreq
bamToFreq is a tool for converting mapped reads from next-generation sequencing (NGS) in terms of a [BAM file] (https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) to the [frequency file format] (http://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky349). BAM files can be generated from FASTQ files using a variety of mappers such as BWA, smalt, or Bowtie. For mapping reads and analyzing resistance of of viral such as HIV-1 from a FASTQ file, there exist freely available pipelines such as [MinVar] (https://github.com/ozagordi/MinVar) or web services such as [PASeq] (https://paseq.org). Other tools such as <a href = "https://ngs.geno2pheno.org">geno2pheno[ngs-freq]</a> require the input of frequency files, which is facilitated by the use bamToFreq.
